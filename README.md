# Creating Family Trees using MS Access
 Do note that this method can only be used in MS Access 2007 because the ActiveX control named Microsoft TreeView Control has been discontinued in later versions of MS Office. The versions of Microsoft Windows released after Windows 7 do not contain the required MSCOMCTL.OCX file required to run Microsoft TreeView Control. So, we need to get them before installing MS Office 2007.

## Getting MSCOMCTL.OCX File
1. Go to this [link from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10019) and download Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Common Controls.
2. Click on Download to download on your PC.
3. Right click and extract downloaded file using WinZip or any other extracting applications.
4. Copy MSCOMCTL.OCX file.
5. Navigate to the below path in C drive,
   - If your Computer is 64 bit- C:\Windows\SysWOW64
   - If your Computer is 32 bit- C:\Windows\System32
6. Paste the file.
